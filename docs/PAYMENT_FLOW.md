# Payment Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the payment flow implementation in the e-commerce application, including both frontend and backend components, state management, and error handling.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Checkout Flow** (`/src/routes/checkout/`)
   - `+page.svelte`: Main checkout page with multi-step flow
   - `shipping/ShippingForm.svelte`: Collects shipping information
   - `payment/PaymentMethod.svelte`: Handles payment method selection
   - `review/OrderConfirmation.svelte`: Displays order confirmation and status

2. **Stores** (`/src/lib/stores/`)
   - `cart.ts`: Manages shopping cart state
   - `stripe.ts`: Handles Stripe.js initialization

3. **Utilities** (`/src/lib/utils/`)
   - `paymentStatus.ts`: Manages payment status polling and notifications
   - `checkout.ts`: Shared checkout utilities

### Backend API

1. **Payment Creation** (`/api/payments/create`)
   - Creates payment intent (Stripe) or preference (MercadoPago)
   - Creates order record in database

2. **Order Status** (`/api/orders/[id]/status`)
   - Retrieves current order and payment status
   - Used for polling updates

3. **Webhooks**
   - `/api/webhooks/stripe`: Handles Stripe webhook events
   - `/api/webhooks/mercadopago`: Handles MercadoPago webhook events

## Payment Flow

### 1. Checkout Initialization
1. User navigates to checkout with items in cart
2. System validates cart contents and availability
3. Shipping information is collected and validated

### 2. Payment Method Selection
1. User selects payment method (Stripe or MercadoPago)
2. System initializes appropriate payment SDK
3. Payment details form is displayed based on selection

### 3. Payment Processing
1. User enters payment details
2. System creates payment intent/preference via API
3. User is redirected to payment provider (if applicable)
4. System handles payment result callback

### 4. Order Confirmation
1. System displays order confirmation with status
2. Real-time status updates via polling
3. User receives order confirmation email

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Payment Declined**
   - Display user-friendly error message
   - Allow retry with different payment method
   - Log detailed error for support

2. **Network Issues**
   - Implement retry logic
   - Show loading states
   - Maintain order state to prevent duplicate charges

3. **Invalid Input**
   - Client-side validation
   - Clear error messages
   - Highlight problematic fields

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock API responses
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test API endpoints with mock data
- Verify database state changes

### End-to-End Tests
- Full checkout flow testing
- Payment provider integration testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**
   - Never store raw payment details
   - Use payment provider elements/tokens
   - Regular security audits

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Regular dependency updates

3. **Fraud Prevention**
   - Implement CVV checks
   - Enable 3D Secure
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Load payment SDKs on demand
   - Code-split large components

2. **Caching**
   - Cache product and pricing data
   - Implement CDN for static assets

3. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Update UI optimistically
   - Handle rollbacks gracefully

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Log all payment failures
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track checkout completion rate
   - Measure time to complete payment
   - Monitor API response times

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Track conversion rates
   - Monitor payment method preferences
   - Analyze cart abandonment

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Payment Methods**
   - Add support for more payment providers
   - Implement digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

2. **Subscription Support**
   - Recurring payments
   - Free trials and discounts

3. **Localization**
   - Support multiple currencies
   - Localized payment methods
   - Region-specific tax calculations
